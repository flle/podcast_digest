  "summary": "<p>There’s a lot of hype about AI agents right now, but developing robust agents isn’t yet a reality in general. Imbue is leading the way towards more robust agents by taking a full-stack approach; from hardware innovations through to user interface. In this episode, Josh, Imbue’s CTO, tell us more about their approach and some of what they have learned along the way.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sponsors:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://graphstuff.fm/episodes/2023-finale-llms-and-knowledge-graphs-throughout-the-year?&amp;utm_campaign=UCGenAI&amp;utm_content=AMS-SrDev-ToFuDev-UCGenAI-Audio-None-GenAI1-GenAI-NonABM&amp;utm_medium=Audio&amp;utm_source=PracticalAI&amp;utm_justglobal=\">Neo4j</a> – Is your code getting dragged down by JOINs and long query times? The problem might be your database…Try simplifying the complex with graphs. Stop asking relational databases to do more than they were made for. Graphs work well for use cases with lots of data connections like supply chain, fraud detection, real-time analytics, and genAI. With Neo4j, you can code in your favorite programming language and against any driver. Plus, it’s easy to integrate into your tech stack. </li><li><a href=\"https://fly.io/changelog\">Fly.io</a> – <strong>The home of Changelog.com</strong> — Deploy your apps and databases close to your users.
