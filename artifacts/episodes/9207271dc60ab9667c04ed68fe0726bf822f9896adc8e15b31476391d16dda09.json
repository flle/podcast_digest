  "summary": "<p>Recently, we briefly mentioned the concept of “Activation Hacking” in the episode with Karan from Nous Research. In this fully connected episode, Chris and Daniel dive into the details of this model control mechanism, also called “representation engineering”. Of course, they also take time to discuss the new Sora model from OpenAI.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sponsors:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.neo4j.com/developer?utm_source=changelog&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=practicalai\">Neo4j</a> – Is your code getting dragged down by JOINs and long query times?
