  "summary": "<p>AI legend Stuart Russell, the Berkeley professor who leads the <em>Center for Human-Compatible AI</em>, joins Chris to share his insights into the future of artificial intelligence. Stuart is the author of <em>Human Compatible</em>, and the upcoming 4th edition of his perennial classic <em>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</em>, which is widely regarded as the standard text on AI. After exposing the shortcomings inherent in deep learning, Stuart goes on to propose a new practitioner approach to creating AI that avoids harmful unintended consequences, and offers a path forward towards a future in which humans can safely rely of provably beneficial AI.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sponsors:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://do.co/changelog\">DigitalOcean</a> – DigitalOcean’s developer cloud makes it simple to launch in the cloud and scale up as you grow.
