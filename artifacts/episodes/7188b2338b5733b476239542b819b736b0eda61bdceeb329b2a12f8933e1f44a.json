  "summary": "<p>In Kenya, 33% of maternal deaths are caused by delays in seeking care, and 55% of maternal deaths are caused by delays in action or inadequate care by providers. Jacaranda Health is employing NLP and dialogue system techniques to help mothers experience childbirth safely and with respect and to help newborns get a safe start in life. Jay and Sathy from Jacaranda join us in this episode to discuss how they are using AI to prioritize incoming SMS messages from mothers and help them get the care they need.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sponsors:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://rudderstack.com/?utm_source=changelog&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=changelog\">RudderStack</a> – Smart customer data pipeline made for developers.
