  "summary": "<p>Can AI-driven autonomy reduce harm, or does it risk dehumanizing decision-making? In this “AI Hot Takes &amp; Debates” series episode, Daniel and Chris dive deep into the ethical crossroads of AI, autonomy, and military applications. They trade perspectives on ethics, precision, responsibility, and whether machines should ever be trusted with life-or-death decisions. It’s a spirited back-and-forth that tackles the big questions behind real-world AI.</p><p>Featuring:</p><ul><li>Chris Benson – <a href=\"https://chrisbenson.com/\">Website</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/chrisbenson\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisbenson\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/chrisbenson\">X</a></li><li>Daniel Whitenack – <a href=\"https://www.datadan.io/\">Website</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/dwhitena\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/dwhitena\">X</a></li></ul><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4342529\">The Concept of \"The Human\" in the Critique of Autonomous Weapons</a></li><li><a href=\"https://harvardnsj.org/2025/05/23/on-the-pitfalls-of-technophilic-reason-a-commentary-on-kevin-jon-hellers-the-concept-of-the-human-in-the-critique-of-autonomous-weapons/\">On the Pitfalls of Technophilic Reason: A Commentary on Kevin Jon Heller’s “The Concept of ‘the Human’ in the Critique of Autonomous Weapons”</a></li></ul><p>Sponsors:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://agntcy.org/\">Outshift by Cisco</a>: AGNTCY is an open source collective building the Internet of Agents.
