  "summary": "<p>There are a lot of people trying to innovate in the area of specialized AI hardware, but most of them are doing it with traditional transistors. Lightmatter is doing something totally different. They’re building photonic computers that are more power efficient and faster for AI inference. Nick Harris joins us in this episode to bring us up to speed on all the details.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sponsors:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.fastly.com/?utm_source=changelog&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=changelog-sponsorship\">Fastly</a> – <strong>Our bandwidth partner.</strong> Fastly powers fast, secure, and scalable digital experiences.
