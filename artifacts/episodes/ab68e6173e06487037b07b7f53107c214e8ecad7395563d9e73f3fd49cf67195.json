  "summary": "<p>To say that Jeff Adams is a trailblazer when it comes to speech technology is an understatement. Along with many other notable accomplishments, his team at Amazon developed the Echo, Dash, and Fire TV changing our perception of how we could interact with devices in our home. Jeff now leads Cobalt Speech and Language, and he was kind enough to join us for a discussion about human computer interaction, multimodal AI tasks, the history of language modeling, and AI for social good.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sponsors:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/changelog\">O'Reilly Media</a> – Learn by doing — Python, data, AI, machine learning, Kubernetes, Docker, and more.
