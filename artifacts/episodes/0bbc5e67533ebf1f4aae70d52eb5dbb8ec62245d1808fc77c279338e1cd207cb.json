  "summary": "<p>A lot of effort is put into the training of AI models, but, for those of us that actually want to run AI models in production, performance and scaling quickly become blockers. Nikita from MemSQL joins us to talk about how people are integrating ML/AI inference at scale into existing SQL-based workflows. He also touches on how model features and raw files can be managed and integrated with distributed databases.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sponsors:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://do.co/changelog\">DigitalOcean</a> – DigitalOcean’s developer cloud makes it simple to launch in the cloud and scale up as you grow.
