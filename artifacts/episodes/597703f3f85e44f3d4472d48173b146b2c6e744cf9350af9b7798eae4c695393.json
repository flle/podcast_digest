  "summary": "<p>We’ve all heard about breaches of privacy and leaks of private health information (PHI). For healthcare providers and those storing this data, knowing where all the sensitive data is stored is non-trivial. Ramin, from Tausight, joins us to discuss how they have deploy edge AI models to help company search through billions of records for PHI.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sponsors:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://graphstuff.fm/episodes/2023-finale-llms-and-knowledge-graphs-throughout-the-year?&amp;utm_campaign=UCGenAI&amp;utm_content=AMS-SrDev-ToFuDev-UCGenAI-Audio-None-GenAI1-GenAI-NonABM&amp;utm_medium=Audio&amp;utm_source=PracticalAI&amp;utm_justglobal=\">Neo4j</a> – Is your code getting dragged down by JOINs and long query times? The problem might be your database…Try simplifying the complex with graphs. Stop asking relational databases to do more than they were made for. Graphs work well for use cases with lots of data connections like supply chain, fraud detection, real-time analytics, and genAI. With Neo4j, you can code in your favorite programming language and against any driver. Plus, it’s easy to integrate into your tech stack. </li><li><a href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup/personal/landing/podcast/practicalai\">Backblaze</a> – Unlimited cloud backup for Macs, PCs, and businesses for just $99/year.
